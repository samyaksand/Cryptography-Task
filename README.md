# Cryptography-Task

## Problem Statement

### You are given the task of breaking into the vault ([Danger-DoNotOpen](https://github.com/samyaksand/Cryptography-Task/blob/main/dontopen.zip)), which is 5 blocks away from your house in a treasury. Due to covid-19, you are required to be fully vaccinated to enter. You found this vaccination certificate ([Alan-vaccination-cert](https://github.com/samyaksand/Cryptography-Task/blob/main/Alan-vaccination-cert.jpg)) which may help you make it past the entrance(ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰) and also to break into the vault. The smile in the certificate is meant to distract you from something hidden in plain sight.
